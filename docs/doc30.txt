One easy way to help minimize the stress of starting a new position is to do a trial run before you start the job. Figure out your transportation and where youâ€™re going. Make the trip a few days ahead of time to see how long it takes, giving yourself a cushion for traffic or other delays. Then give yourself a little extra time so you can arrive at work a few minutes early on your first day.
