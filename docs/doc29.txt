It’s absolutely fine to ask questions ahead of time. Depending on your organization, you can ask the Human Resources representative or your supervisor any questions. If you’re not sure who to ask, check with the person who offered you the job. Find out about your work schedule, the hours per week you are expected to work, salary, benefits, and any information you need to successfully come on board.
